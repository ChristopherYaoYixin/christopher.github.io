      <p>Mount Huangshan, known as one of the most beautiful mountains in China, has a unique natural landscape and profound cultural heritage, attracting countless tourists to visit.
        Mount Huangshan is famous for its "five wonders" of strange pines, strange rocks, sea of clouds, hot springs, winter snow and "five wonders" of historical relics, calligraphy and painting, literature, legends and celebrities. It is also known as "the most wonderful mountain in the world", "Tiankai Picture" and "Songhai Yunchuan". When you stand on the top of Mount Huangshan Mountain, looking around, the mountains are continuous and the clouds are swirling, as if you are in a fairyland.
        In Mount Huangshan Mountain, you can walk along the ancient mountaineering trails and through the dense pine forests to feel the magic charm of nature. Along the way, you will see strange stones of various shapes, which have been eroded by billions of years of wind and rain, forming a unique landscape. You can also enjoy the spectacular sea of clouds, as if standing on top of the sea of clouds, floating like an immortal.</p>

      <p>In Zhangjiajie City, Hunan Province, Tianmen Mountain is known for its magnificent mountain terrain and magnificent natural scenery. The Tianmen Mountain here rose during the Yanshan Movement and was sculpted by the Himalayan orogeny, forming the current karst mountain landscape. The mountaintop forest is a primitive sub forest with abundant wildlife and plant resources, presenting a vibrant natural landscape for tourists. In addition, the Tianmen Mountain Tourist Area also integrates peaks, rocks, springs, streams, clouds, and forests, and is divided into four major tourist areas: Biye Yaotai, Seeking Immortal Wonderland, Tianjie Buddha Kingdom, and Tianmen Cave, each of which is full of mystery and fantasy.</p>
